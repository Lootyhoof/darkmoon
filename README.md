# Dark Moon
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/38XTZLf.png)

Dark theme for Pale Moon, based on [White Moon](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/whitemoon).

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

On Unix systems (or Windows 10, with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) you can optionally run `build.sh` instead. Running this as-is will produce a .xpi file ending in `-dev`, and if run from the command line and appending a number (e.g. `./build.sh 2`) will append that number to the filename instead.

## Download
You can grab the latest release either from the Releases section of this repository, or the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/darkmoon/).
